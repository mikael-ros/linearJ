# ‚ÜóÔ∏è linearJ

A tool for doing linear algebra calculations.

Functionality is based on the needs of the book [Linj√§r Algebra by Jonas M√•nsson](https://www.studentlitteratur.se/kurslitteratur/matematik-och-statistik/algebra-och-diskret-matematik/linjar-algebra-39996-01/).

### ü§î Motivation
Knowing full well these kinds of tools already exist, this projects purpose is not to replace any existing tools (as it just is not as encompassing), but just to learn.

As I'm doing this project to aid my learning of linear algebra, I chose to use Java to develop it, solely because I'm already confident in it and don't want to learn a new programming language while learning something at the same time.
Java is actually probably a poor contender for a project of this type, and it would probably be better to develop it in something like C or Rust... but yeah.

### üî® Usage
Currently, the only way to use the program is through the command line or through JUnit tests.

### ü™ö Contributing
Generally try to work in a test-driven (test first) manner, and stick to working one issue/feature at a time (creating branches and pull requests for each one).

The spirit of the project is to stick as closely as possible to knowledge gained throughout the mentioned book, but if you have good reasons to implement code that would be vastly more performant while abandoning the techniques given in the book, feel free to do so - just don't remove old methods.

Generally stick to primitive types. 

The idea as it stands now, since I completed the course, is that people who read this course after me are free to continue this project to aid in their learning as well.
