# linearJ

A tool for doing linear algebra calculations.

Functionality is based on the needs of the book Linjar Algebra by Jonas Mansson.

### Motivation
Knowing full well these kinds of tools already exist, this projects purpose is not to replace any existing tools (as it just is not as encompassing), but just to learn.

As I'm doing this project to aid my learning of linear algebra, I chose to use Java to develop it, solely because I'm already confident in it and don't want to learn a new programming language while learning something at the same time.
Java is actually probably a poor contender for a project of this type, and it would probably be better to develop it in something like C or Rust... but yeah.
